# outlier-waveform-detection

This repository shares Matlab code that identifies single units with spike waveforms that take on outlier feature values. 

To recreate the outlier detection performed on sets of GPi units obtained from two nonhuman primates (in healthy and parkinsonian states), follow two steps: 

(1) Download the dataset from Zenodo: "Data to accompany the outlier-waveform-detection Github repository"\
(2) Process the data using the instructions in "how_to_recreate_GPi_results.txt".

All Matlab files were originally generated using version R2022a, and draw upon optional toolboxes that Mathworks provides for that version.

This code and the associated Zenodo data were used for analyses reported in an in-preparation manuscript (Kase et al., "Movement-related activity in the internal globus pallidus of the parkinsonian macaque"), and also for a preprint that is currently under review:
